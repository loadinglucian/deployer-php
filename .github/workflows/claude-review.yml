              <step name="get-diff-context">
                Use `gh pr diff` to get the full diff for this PR.

                Extract and store:
                1. List of modified files (code files: *.php, *.js, *.ts, *.sh)
                2. Command files: app/Console/**/*Command.php
                3. For each file, the specific line ranges that were added or modified
                   - Parse diff hunks to identify changed line numbers
                   - Store as: {filepath: [changed_lines]}
              </step>

              <step name="trace-analysis">
                For each modified code file, spawn trace-agent using the Task tool:
                - subagent_type: trace-agent
                - prompt: "Analyze {filepath} for bugs and issues.

                  IMPORTANT: This file was modified in a PR. The following lines were changed:
                  {list of changed line numbers from step 1}

                  Categorize each finding as:
                  - 'new': Issue is ON or DIRECTLY CAUSED BY a changed line
                  - 'pre-existing': Issue is on unchanged code, not caused by PR changes

                  Return findings as JSON:
                  {
                    \"new_issues\": [
                      {\"path\": \"relative/file/path.php\", \"line\": 42, \"severity\": \"high|medium|low\", \"message\": \"Description\"}
                    ],
                    \"pre_existing\": [
                      {\"path\": \"relative/file/path.php\", \"line\": 10, \"severity\": \"medium\", \"message\": \"Description\"}
                    ],
                    \"general\": [\"Issues without specific line numbers\"]
                  }"

                Run analyses in parallel where possible.
              </step>

              <step name="docs-check">
                For each modified command file (app/Console/**/*Command.php), spawn docs-agent:
                - subagent_type: docs-agent
                - prompt: "Check if documentation for {command_name} needs updating based on changes in {filepath}"

                Run in parallel with trace-analysis where possible.
              </step>

              <step name="collect-findings">
                Aggregate all findings from trace-agent results into:
                1. new_inline: Array of {path, line, severity, message} for NEW issues on changed lines
                2. pre_existing_inline: Array of {path, line, severity, message} for pre-existing issues
                3. general_issues: Array of strings for issues without line numbers
                4. doc_updates: Array of documentation findings from docs-agent
              </step>

              <step name="fetch-prior-comments">
                Fetch all existing review comments on this PR to avoid duplicates:
                gh api repos/${{ github.repository }}/pulls/${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}/comments

                For each comment, extract:
                - id: Comment ID (for replying)
                - path: File path
                - line: Line number (original_line or line)
                - body: Comment text
                - user.login: Who posted it
                - in_reply_to_id: If this is a reply to another comment

                Build two lists:
                1. claude_comments: Comments posted by claude[bot] - these are prior issues raised
                2. addressed_issues: Claude comments that have a reply from the PR author (loadinglucian or PR opener)
                   - An issue is "addressed" if the PR author replied to explain/acknowledge it
              </step>

              <step name="deduplicate-findings">
                Before posting new comments, filter out duplicates:

                For each finding in new_inline, check against claude_comments:
                - DUPLICATE if: Same file AND line within ±5 lines AND similar issue type
                  (e.g., both mention "null", both mention "validation", both mention same concept)
                - If duplicate found: Remove from new_inline, do NOT post again

                For addressed_issues (Claude comment + author reply):
                - Do NOT re-post the issue
                - Instead, add to acknowledgment_queue for friendly follow-up

                Result:
                - filtered_new_inline: Only genuinely new issues to post
                - acknowledgment_queue: [{comment_id, author_reply, issue_summary}] for friendly replies
              </step>

              <step name="acknowledge-addressed">
                Spawn `pr-comment` agents **IN PARALLEL** for all items in acknowledgment_queue.

                **IMPORTANT:** Use a SINGLE message with MULTIPLE Task tool calls.

                For each item, use the Task tool with `subagent_type: "pr-comment"`:

                ````
                Post a reply to this PR comment:

                **PR:** ${{ github.repository }}#${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
                **Comment ID:** {comment_id}
                **Type:** review_comment

                **Context:** The PR author replied to our previous comment.
                **Author's reply:** {author_reply}
                **Original issue:** {issue_summary}

                Reply with a friendly acknowledgment that shows we understood their explanation.
                ````

                After all agents complete, count total acknowledgments posted.
              </step>

              <step name="submit-review">
                Submit a GitHub code review with inline comments using the API.
                IMPORTANT: Use filtered_new_inline (after deduplication), NOT new_inline.

                1. Build the review summary body:
                   ## Code Review Summary

                   ### Issues from PR Changes
                   **{X} inline comments** on {Y} files
                   {Or "✅ No new issues introduced by this PR"}

                   {If any duplicates were skipped, add:}
                   > ℹ️ {N} issues from prior reviews were not re-posted

                   ### Pre-existing Issues
                   <details>
                   <summary>{N} pre-existing issues found (not caused by this PR)</summary>

                   | File | Line | Severity | Issue |
                   |------|------|----------|-------|
                   {table rows for pre_existing_inline}

                   </details>
                   {Or "None detected"}

                   ### General Issues
                   {List general_issues, or "None"}

                   ### Documentation
                   {List doc_updates, or "All docs up to date"}

                2. Build the comments array from filtered_new_inline only (inline comments). Each needs:
                   - path: relative file path
                   - line: line number in the file
                   - side: "RIGHT" (for additions/changes)
                   - body: severity emoji + message (🔴 high, 🟡 medium, 🟢 low)

                   Note: Pre-existing issues go in the summary table, NOT as inline comments.
                   Note: Duplicate/addressed issues are SKIPPED entirely - handled in acknowledge-addressed step.

                3. Submit the review using --input to pass JSON via stdin:
                   gh api -X POST repos/${{ github.repository }}/pulls/${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}/reviews --input - <<'EOF'
                   {
                     "commit_id": "${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }}",
                     "body": "SUMMARY_TEXT",
                     "event": "COMMENT",
                     "comments": [JSON_ARRAY]
                   }
                   EOF

                4. If no new inline comments but other findings exist, submit review with just summary body.

                5. If no issues at all AND no acknowledgments were posted, submit: "✅ No issues found in this PR."

                6. If only acknowledgments were posted (all new findings were duplicates), submit:
                   "✅ No new issues - responded to {N} prior comments above."
              </step>

            </protocol>

            Begin by getting the list of modified files from the PR.

          # See https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action/blob/main/docs/usage.md
