## Development Rules

All rules MANDATORY.

### Mission

Build Deployer PHP: Composer package and CLI tool simplifying server provisioning and deployment across multiple Cloud providers.

### Before ANY Task

- Check `composer.json` and `package.json` for installed packages
- Plan with features from installed major versions
- Use Context7 MCP

### Code Philosophy

**Minimalism:**

- Write minimum code necessary - no more, no less
- Always ask: can less code achieve same result?
- Refactor relentlessly for clarity and necessity
- Eliminate single-use methods: inline if called once
- Cache computed values: initialize expensive calculations in constructor
- Avoid method call overhead: direct property access when appropriate

**Organization:**

- Catalog like a librarian
- Group related functions into comment-separated sections
- Prefer alphabetical ordering when no logical grouping exists
- Code should be functional and visually appealing

**Consistency:**

- Maintain rigorous consistency across codebase
- Same style, standards, aesthetic principles throughout
- Review surrounding code for reusable patterns
- Code should appear written by single person: naming, parameter precedence, logic flow, organization

### Execution Protocol

1. ULTRATHINK - analyze problem deeply
2. STEP BY STEP - break into logical steps
3. ACT - implement systematically

### Tests

Don't run or create or update tests UNLESS explicitly instructed to do so.

Test are something we need to focus on separately from building features.
