description: Review all changes in current branch vs base
model: opus
---

Meticulously catalog and analyze all the changes in this branch, compared to the branch it's based on.

Review against our documented rules in:
- docs/rules/architecture.md
- docs/rules/commands.md
- docs/rules/exceptions.md
- docs/rules/testing.md

Focus on where changes fall short of our development, architecture and testing rules as well as finding potential bugs and regressions.

Provide a detailed report but don't make any changes yet.
